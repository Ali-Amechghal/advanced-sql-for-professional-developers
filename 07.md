## Case Expression

Case expressions are very similar to if statements in other programming languages.

This is how we initiate a case statement.

```sql
select first_name,
case when status is null then 'member' else status end
from users;
```

`cases` statements are made up of `case when`, an expression, the `then` keyword, the results we want returned, and the `end` keyword which ends the case statement.

Here's a diagram to help :)

### Making More Complex Case Expressions

We can make our case statements more complex by adding more `when`'s and `then`'s.

### Using `where` in `case` Statements

If we would like to add additional filters for our table data, we can use `where`.

```sql
select first_name,
case when status is null then 'member' else status end
from users
where status is not null;
```

The `where` statement above will return the opposite of the above code.

## `case` Statements within `where` Statements

We can use a `case`statement inside of a `where` statement.

```sql
where case when email is not null then start_date > '2019-01-01' end;
```

**KEY TAKEAWAY: Case statements can be used wherever an expression is valid.**
