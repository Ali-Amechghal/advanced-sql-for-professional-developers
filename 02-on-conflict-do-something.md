# On Conflict Do Something Clause 

- if we want to have completely unique records, like user accounts with email info, we have to check to see if data already exists in the DB and *then* insert the data only if it does not. 

- normally this would require 2 separate queries, but postgres offers a solution... 

```
  postgres=# insert into users (user_handle, first_name, last_name, email) values (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Lucie', 'Jones', 'Lucie-Jones@gmail.com') on conflict do nothing; 
```
  **`on conflict do nothing` is the important part to notice here...** 

- When this runs, if there is a conflict found the record will not be entered into the DB
- We can also choose to `update` instead of doing `nothing` 

```
  postgres=# insert into users values (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Lucie', 'Hawkins', 'Lucie-Jones@gmail.com') on conflict (email) do update set first_name = excluded.first_name, last_name = excluded.last_name; 
```
- With this command (`on conflict <column name> do`), you choose the column in which there is a conflict (user has same email address, but has changed their last name, in this case), and then define the columns you wants to update when this conflict occurs. *(eg. Lucie Jones' name will be updated to Lucie Hawkins because her account was identified by the email address conflict)*

- the `excluded.` refers to incoming data for that column 

- This action is commonly referred to as an **"upsert"** 

- We can also update this query with a `where` clause... 

```
  postgres=# insert into users as u values (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Lucie', 'Cook', 'Lucie-Jones@gmail.com') on conflict (email) do update set first_name = excluded.first_name, last_name = excluded.last_name where u.first_name <> 'Lucie'; 
```
  **<> for *'does not equal'***

- In this example, if there is an `email` conflict *and*  the original records `firstname` is equal to 'Lucie' the row will not be updated
