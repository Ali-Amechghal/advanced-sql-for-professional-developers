# [Bulk Insert and Export Data with CSV Files](https://egghead.io/lessons/postgresql-bulk-insert-and-export-data-with-csv-files)

This is the format when using Postgres:

```sql
  postgres=# copy <table name> <column names> from '<full file path to CSV file>' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER; 
```

This comand will bulk insert all rows from the file into the table.

The `copy` command makes this possible. Defining columns is optional, and renames the columns from the original file. If left out, `HEADER` will be pulled in from the imported file. 

In this case, the `DELIMITER` defaults to tabs, but with CSV we need to choose commas (this works like a key value pair).

And `CSV` and `HEADER` are two separate options: `CSV` for the file type, `HEADER` tells the `copy` command that the first row in the file contains headers and shouldn't be copied into the DB.

If you change "from" to "to" you can **export a copy of data** to the file **FROM the DB** as a CSV.
